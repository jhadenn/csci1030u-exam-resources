Write a regular expression to recognize a basic street address, briefly described as follows

One or more digits (0-9) followed by one or more words, each of which is one or more upper or lowercase letters, separated by spaces.

Below are some examples of strings that would be a part of this language:

2000 Simcoe Road North
290 Bremner Blvd
123 Apple

^\d+\s[A-Za-z]+(?:\s[A-Za-z+])*$

^: Asserts the start of the string.
\d+: Matches one or more digits (0-9).
\s: Matches a single whitespace character.
[A-Za-z]+: Matches one or more upper or lowercase letters.
(?:\s[A-Za-z]+)*: Non-capturing group that allows for zero or more additional words separated by spaces.
$: Asserts the end of the string.
